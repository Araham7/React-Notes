### (A). `React, props`

In `React, props` (short for "properties") are used to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent component to a child component. They are a core part of how React manages component interaction and data flow.

Here’s how props work in React:

`Passing Data`: When you define a component, you can pass data to it via props. The component then has access to this data and can use it to render dynamic content.

`Immutable`: Props are read-only in the child component, meaning the child component cannot change the props it receives from the parent. This one-way data flow is a fundamental principle in React.

`Accessing Props`: In a functional component, you access props directly from the component’s function argument. In a class component, you access props through `this.props`.

`Dynamic Content`: By passing props, components become more reusable and can display dynamic content based on the data passed to them.

# Adding `class` in a React component:

- To assign a` class` to a React component, we use the `className` keyword.

# Adding `id` in a React component:

- To assign an `id` to a React component, we use the `id=""` keyword.
